# Task Switching Paradigm

Hello! This paradigm switching between three tasks: the spatial rotation, digit span, and spatial span. These tasks were chosen to maximize switch cost in a cued, task switching paradigm. 

This task was coded to be MRI and EEG compatible, but requires installation of this package:

       pip install git+https://github.com/tiborauer/pyniexp.git

If you have any questions please reach out to me at danielle.kurtin18@imperial.ac.uk. Happy task switching!
